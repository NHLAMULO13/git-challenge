      <h4>How to make Malva pudding</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the pudding batter:</strong> Melt the apricot jam,
          butter, sugar and vinegar together over medium-high heat in a small
          saucepan. Cool slightly then pour into a large bowl
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Combine dry ingredients:</strong> Stir the dry ingredients
          together in a medium mixing bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mix the batter:</strong>
          Add the dry ingredients and milk to the butter mixture, alternating,
          until the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake:</strong> Pour the batter into a greased baking dish then
          place in a preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes until golden brown
          and a skewer inserted comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Prepare the syrup:</strong> Combine all the syrup ingredients
          in a small saucepan then bring to a boil and simmer together for 5
          minutes. Once the pudding comes out of the oven, pour over the sponge
          and allow to soak for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the warm pudding with custard, cream or
          a scoop of ice cream

        <strong>Tips for the best Malva Pudding:</strong>
        <br />
        Ensure all the ingredients are at room temperature before making the
        batter.Don't over-bake the pudding. It should be moist and tender.Pour
        the hot syrup over the pudding immediately as it comes out of the oven
        for maximum absorption.Using golden syrup in the sauce really enhances
        the flavor. Maple syrup or honey can be used as substitute.Can you
        freeze Malva pudding? Malva pudding freezes very well. Cool the baked
        pudding, wrap with foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat from
        frozen for 30 minutes or until hot throughout then pour over extra syrup
        to make sure it's super moist. Malva pudding can also be made in advance
        and kept in the fridge for up to a day in advance. Reheat before
        serving.
