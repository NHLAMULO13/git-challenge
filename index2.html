        Banana Bread with Oil (No Butter Banana Bread) This banana bread with
        oil recipe is tasty and simple to make. Your family will love this
        delicious no butter banana bread. My easy recipe simply replaces the
        butter used in most banana bread recipes with vegetable oil. It is the
        perfect solution if you have run out of butter late at night (“$@&%! No
        more butter in the fridge. How do I make banana bread now?“), can't get
        to the store (due to snow, rainstorms, etc.) and/or want to reduce the
        saturated fat associated with butter. Moreover, this no butter banana
        bread tastes just like a traditional old-fashioned banana bread.

      <strong>Servings:</strong> Roughly 12 slices
      <br />
      <strong>Equipment Needed:</strong> Measuring cup & spoons, mixing bowl,
      long wooden spoon, 9 by 5 inch metal bread pan, oven mitts, silicon
      spatula, cooling rack and an oven.

      <p>
        <strong>Instructions</strong>
        <br />
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (163 degrees C).
        <br />
        Mash bananas with a fork. Lightly beat eggs.
        <br />
        Mix bananas, vegetable oil, eggs and sugar together in a large mixing
        bowl. Stir until completely mixed.
        <br />
        Mix in the remaining ingredients.
        <br />
        Stir until the batter is fully mixed. FYI – I prefer to use a large
        spoon to mix the batter. An electric mixer can overmix the batter and
        this can lead to gummy & rubbery banana breads.
        <br />
        Optional – If you want to enhance this “basic” no butter banana bread,
        you can stir in a cup of your family’s favorite dessert ingredient (e.g.
        chocolate chips or chopped walnuts) after you have mixed the batter.
        <br />
        Pour the finished batter into a nonstick bread pan. Smooth out the top
        of the batter within the bread pan.
        <br />
        Bake in the oven at 325 F (163 C) for 65-70 minutes.
        <br />
        Take out of the oven and let the banana bread cool down in the bread pan
        for 10 minutes.
        <br />
        <strong
          >Do not remove the banana bread from the bread pan during this 10
          minute cool down period.</strong
        >
        Use oven mitts as the bread pan will be very hot coming out of the oven.
        <br />
        FYI- Do not skip this step as the “cool down” completes the baking
        process.
        <br />
        After 10 minutes, remove the banana bread from the bread pan.
        <br />
        Place the banana bread on a cooling rack in order to completely cool.
        <br />
        This cool down may take 1-2 hours. Gently slide a silicon spatula
        between the banana bread and the bread pan walls if the banana bread is
        stuck in the pan.
